# Hand-Gesture-Recogniton-to-control-media-players.
**Human Computer Interaction can acquire several advantages with the
introduction of different natural forms of device free communication.
Gestures are a natural form of actions which we often use in our daily life for
interaction, therefore to use it as a communication medium with computers
generates a new paradigm of interaction with computers. This project
implements computer vision and gesture recognition techniques and develops
a vision based low cost input device for controlling the VLC player through
gestures. In this project,system will continuously take input using webcam.If
the webcamera detects hand gestures then they are used for performing
various events like increasing or decreasing the volume,pausing and resuming
